I learned how to method chain and manipulate classes

myObject2 .overrideArithmentFunction1(d => d*d) 

this is an example of an instance of a class being manipulated.


var myObject2 = myClass();

why is there a ";" here but not here?? ** ASK LECTURER

cubeArrayElements = myClass() 
		.overrideArithmentFunction1(d=>d*d*d) 
		.loadAndProcessData([1,2,3,4,"z"]);
